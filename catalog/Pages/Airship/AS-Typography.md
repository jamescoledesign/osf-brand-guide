We will generally use [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) for most things Airhip. In cases where Roboto is unavailable, a sans-serif like Helvetica or Arial will suffice. The examples below use different sizes and weights to demonstrate the visual hierarchy between headlines and body copy.

##### Roboto

```type
{
  "font": "Roboto",
  "headings": [
    { "label": "Headline", "value": 30, "weight": 800, }
  ],
  "paragraphs": [
    { "label": "Body Copy", "value": "14/20.5" }
  ]
}
```
