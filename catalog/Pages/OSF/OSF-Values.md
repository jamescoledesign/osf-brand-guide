We are guided by a set of principles called The Four Opens. They were created by the OpenStack community as a way to guarantee that the users get all the benefits associated with open source software, including the ability to engage with the community and influence future evolution of the software.

###### **THE FOUR OPENS:**

# Open Source
Any software developed under the Four Opens must be released under an open source license. It means being able to study a program, modify it, and redistribute either the original or the modified version so that others may benefit from your work. 

# Open Community
“Open Community” embodies the key difference with single-vendor-controlled open source projects. It is about ensuring that the community is a cohesive, inclusive, level playing ground where all the voices are heard and anyone can rise to leadership positions.

# Open Development
“Open Development” refers to the adoption of transparent and inclusive development processes that enable everyone to participate as an equal on a level playing field. 

# Open Design
“Open Design” guarantees a transparent and open process for planning and designing the software. It’s about letting go of the control of the design of the software and its feature road-map, and accepting that it should be driven by the community.
