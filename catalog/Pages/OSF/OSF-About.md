With over 100,000 members in 187 countries, the OpenStack Foundation helps open source communities build the tools infrastructure operators need for Data Center Clouds, 5G, Edge, Containers, CI/CD and beyond.

Although we're big fans of long names (looking at you, _Open Infrastructure Summit_), we commonly refer to the OpenStack Foundation as the OSF.
